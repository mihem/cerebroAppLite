# Build the REAL single-cell antigen-selected TCR demo (.crb)
#   -> inst/extdata/v1.4/demo_hla_tcr_dextramer.crb
# ============================================================================
# This is the ONLY HLA demo the package ships. It replaced two earlier ones
# (2026-07-21): a fully fabricated fixture and a real BULK TCRb cohort. Neither
# was both real and single-cell, and cerebroAppLite is a single-cell app. Their
# build scripts are kept in data-raw/ as the reproducibility record --
# build_hla_tcr_demo.R and build_hla_tcr_bulk_demo.R -- but what they write into
# inst/extdata/v1.4/ is no longer tracked or installed. See data-raw/hla.md S1.
#
# Because this demo is sorted CD8+ T cells, its typing is CLASS I ONLY, so the
# Class I x Class II pair scope stays hidden on it (hla_pair_available() gates
# the control). That is a real gap, stated rather than papered over.
#
# WHY THIS DATA SET EXISTS
# ------------------------
# The honest objection to the motif page is: "if the network is only legible on
# synthetic data, what is the feature for?" The answer is that a CDR3 Hamming-1
# network needs a repertoire that has been ANTIGEN-SELECTED. An unselected
# polyclonal repertoire is sparse in CDR3 space -- pairs at distance 1 are rare,
# and more cells do not fix it. A selected repertoire converges: many donors
# arrive at near-identical CDR3s for the same epitope (public / convergent
# recombination), which is exactly what the network draws.
#
# Measured on this source with THIS PACKAGE's own motif core (not a claim, a
# number -- the verification block at the bottom re-measures it on the shipped
# object):
#
#   all cells, unselected         26,449 unique CDR3  -> trips the size guard
#   dextramer-binding cells        2,910 unique CDR3  ->  308 nodes / 75 motifs
#   one epitope: Flu-MP GILGFVFTL    267 unique CDR3  ->  121 nodes /  7 motifs
#
# The Flu M1 line is the point: 45% of the CDR3s seen against one immunodominant
# epitope collapse into SEVEN families. That is real measured convergence.
#
# SOURCE
# ------
# 10x Genomics, "CD8+ T cells of Healthy Donor 1-4" (2019), the dextramer /
# Immune Map experiment published as Zhang et al., Sci Adv 7:eabf5835 (2021).
# CD8+ T cells from four HLA-haplotyped healthy donors were stained with a pool
# of dCODE dextramers, sorted, and run on 10x 5' immune profiling: paired ab TCR
# + transcriptome + surface protein + per-cell dextramer counts.
# License: CC BY 4.0.
#
# WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS DERIVED  (read this before trusting any number)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   REAL, measured:
#     * the cells, their transcriptomes, their surface protein counts
#     * the paired TCR alpha/beta contigs -- V/J gene and CDR3 amino acids
#     * which dextramer each cell bound (10x's own binarized calls)
#     * the HLA restriction of each dextramer: it is a property of the reagent,
#       stated in the reagent's name (A0201_GILGFVFTL_Flu-MP -> HLA-A*02:01)
#
#     * the donors' HLA GENOTYPES, transcribed from table S1 of the paper's
#       supplementary PDF (inline as DONOR_HLA below, with citation and URL).
#       They were measured independently of these cells, so they can carry an
#       association claim.
#
#   NOT established -- and this is the important one:
#     * that a cell which bound a reagent is genuinely SPECIFIC for that
#       reagent's peptide, or that the reagent's allele is the one presenting
#       it in that donor. 10x's binarized flags are raw binder calls, and
#       dextramer staining is famously cross-reactive at this scale. Measured
#       on the shipped cells: the bound reagent's restriction is ABSENT from
#       the donor's published genotype for a majority of them (the exact
#       per-donor counts are asserted and printed by the verification block).
#       donor3 is the extreme case -- nearly all of its cells bind reagents
#       restricted by alleles it does not carry.
#       Therefore the per-cell columns are named `dextramer_*`, never
#       "antigen-specific", and a `restriction_in_genotype` column ships beside
#       them so the noise is visible in the app rather than described in a
#       footnote. These calls must NOT be read as peptide-level specificity,
#       and no HLA-association claim rests on them: the associations use the
#       published genotypes, which are independent of binding.
#
# WHY THE GENOTYPES ARE NOT INFERRED FROM BINDING
# -----------------------------------------------
# An earlier version of this script derived each donor's alleles from which
# dextramers their cells bound. That was circular AND wrong. Circular, because a
# donor would be a carrier of HLA-X precisely because their cells bound an
# X-restricted reagent, and the motifs come from those same cells. Wrong,
# because binding is simply not genotype: donor3 has 25,674 cells -- 92.8% of
# its antigen-specific cells -- binding A*03:01-restricted dextramers, and
# table S1 shows it carries no A*03:01 at all (it is A*24:02 / A*29:02). No
# threshold separates cross-reactivity at that scale. The published table is
# used instead, and the demo can therefore ship real genotypes.
#
# WHAT REMAINS DECLARED
# ---------------------
# The repertoire is still ANTIGEN-SELECTED: cells were sorted for dextramer
# binding, so this is not an unbiased repertoire and the page says so through
# `technical_info$tcr_selection`. That is a statement about how the cells were
# chosen, not about the genotypes, which are independent.

## The donors' REAL genotypes: table S1 ("HLA haplotypes of the healthy donors")
## of the paper's supplementary PDF, transcribed by hand. Kept inline so this
## script is self-contained -- it is 14 rows, and a separate file would only be
## one more thing to keep in step.
##
##   Supplement (Figs. S1-S11, Tables S1-S5), ~6 MB:
##   https://www.science.org/doi/suppl/10.1126/sciadv.abf5835/suppl_file/abf5835_sm.pdf
##   (the link printed inside the paper, advances.sciencemag.org/.../DC1, is dead:
##    that domain was retired when Science migrated to science.org)
##
## Table S1 gives two HLA-A and two HLA-B alleles per donor, "na" where the paper
## reports none -- which is why donors 1 and 2 contribute a single B allele.
## Donor 4 is homozygous A*03:01. `copy` is 1 or 2 within a locus, matching the
## canonical HLA table this package stores.
##
## This matters more than it looks. An earlier version of this script inferred
## the genotypes from which dextramers each donor's cells bound, and that
## inference was WRONG: donor3 has 25,674 cells (92.8% of its specific cells)
## binding A*03:01-restricted dextramers and is not an A*03:01 carrier at all --
## it is A*24:02 / A*29:02. Binding is not genotype, and cross-reactivity is far
## larger than a threshold can separate. The published table is used instead.
