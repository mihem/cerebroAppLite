# test-spatial-group-hulls.R — unit tests for per-group convex hulls used to
# outline spatial regions.
#
# The categorical spatial plot can outline each colour group by its convex hull
# so the tissue regions read at a glance. This is the pure geometry behind that:
# given point coordinates and a group label per point, return the closed convex
# hull (x/y vertex vectors, first vertex repeated at the end) for each group
# that has enough points to enclose an area.
